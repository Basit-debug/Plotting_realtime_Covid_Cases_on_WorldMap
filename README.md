Plotting real-time CoronaVirus Cases On World Map using MapBox and JavaScript Fetch API and AJAX methods
While both Google Map and Mapbox APIs are providing great features and functionalities to the users, although it is difficult to give a verdict about which API is better 
than the other, the Mapbox API is clearly ahead of Google maps API in terms of performance and customization.
I used the fetch() method of JavaScript in this mini project. Fetch is used to request to the server and load the information in the webpages. The request can be of any 
APIs that returns the data of the format JSON. This method returns a promise.
